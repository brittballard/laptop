#!/bin/bash

# This script ensures you have `goimports` installed,
# then runs it on the files you name on the input,
# supplying options needed for the local module (go list -m).

# The goimports program performs Go formatting on a file
# (so it can be used as a drop-in replacement for `gofmt`)
# and also intelligently updates import lists,
# adding missing imports and removing unused ones.
# See https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports.

# Imports are collected into (up to) three groups, and sorted within each group.
# First: imports of standard Go packages.
# Second: imports of third-party packages via github.com et al.
# Third (with the "-local mod" command-line option): imports of local packages.
# See https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/tools/+/25145/

# You can configure your text editor to run this script. Vim example:
# let g:go_fmt_command = "goimportslocal"
