#!/bin/bash

# This script ensures you have `goimports` installed,
# then runs it on the files you name on the input,
# supplying options needed for the local module (go list -m).

# The goimports program performs Go formatting on a file
# (so it can be used as a drop-in replacement for `gofmt`)
# and also intelligently updates import lists,
# adding missing imports and removing unused ones.
# See https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports.

# Imports are collected into (up to) three groups, and sorted within each group.
# First: imports of standard Go packages.
# Second: imports of third-party packages via github.com et al.
# Third: imports of local packages.
# Example:

# import (
#   "context"
#   "time"
#
#   "github.com/lib/pq"
#
#   "chain/errors"
#   "chain/log"
#   "chain/net"
# )
