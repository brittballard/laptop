# Internship or Apprenticeship

What's the difference between an internship and an apprenticeship?

## Internship

An intern is someone who:

* wants to explore many options for their next job, or career in general
* is probably in school
* may be unpaid

A company who hires interns:

* often has special project work that is a good fit for part-time employees
* knows it's likely the intern will work or study elsewhere
  after their internship

## Apprenticeship

An apprentice is someone who:

* knows what type of job they want next, or what kind of career they want
* is probably not in school
* is almost always paid

A company who hires apprentices:

* has apprentices work side-by-side with expert employees on typical work
* often hires them for craft work, such as software development
* expects that the apprentice will work for them after the apprenticeship

## No value judgements

Neither an internship nor an apprenticeship is bad and the other good.

Someone who isn't sure they want to be a web developer
might feel overwhelmed in a rigorous apprenticeship.
Someone who craves pair-programming with an expert
may feel frustrated in an internship.

Similarly,
not every company is able to provide one-on-one support
that are necessary in an apprenticeship.

## Who cares

Setting expectations for everyone involved doesn't hurt.
