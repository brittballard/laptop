## Float

Float is a gap in the availability of funds transferred between two parties.

It beneficial for a party that holds funds before paying out.
It is costly for a party that pays out prior to receiving funds.

"Federal Reserve float" occurs when the Fed, as a check clearing house,
credits a deposit bank for funds received prior to collecting from paying bank.

"Disbursement float" occurs during the time between
when an organization mails a check
and the time the check is presented to its bank for payment.

A payments system that reduces float for parties lowers risk for those parties.
