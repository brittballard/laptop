## Consumer

What really matters in shaping consumer behavior around new ways to pay:

* Big increase in convenience
* Big perceived financial gains

Any friction reduces consumer acceptance.

Financial gains have to be significant to matter to consumers.
Rich rewards programs have been successfully at developing loyalty.

Consumers say they care about security but
fail to adopt more secure solutions.

Sell more:

The point of sale environment is changing for merchants:

  which also support contactless cards and NFC mobile payments
* NFC seems to be the winning technology for mobile payments
* Merchants are being offered a range of mobile marketing options,
  delivering coupons and offers for redemption at point of sale.
  These may take advantage of location-aware smartphones.
* Consumers might buy in-store, in-aisle from their phone,
  might use self-checkout.
* Mobile card acceptance programs (Square) have crept upmarket from
  the original micro-merchant users. Phones and tablets
  are increasingly being used for away-from-cash-register checkout.
