## Overview

The ACH system:

* has "push" and "pull" payments
* is owned by banks
* is governed by NACHA rules and Federal Reserve Bank regulation
* economics are "clears at par" except for "same day"
* processes electronically in batch
* manages risk by intermediaries and end parties

ACH (Automated Clearing House) is one of largest payments systems in U.S.
The non-profit NACHA: The Electronic Payments Association serves as trustee
of the network and manages regulatory and rule-making processes,
which define the NACHA Operating Rules.

Started in 1970s by bankers working in check processing automation.
With check readers/sorters,
only MICR data was required to post transactions to customer accounts.
Why not exchange MICR data directly
instead of exchanging checks and extracting MICR data?

In the early days, ACH focused on high-volume, low-risk, repetitive transactions
like payroll, social security benefits, and insurance premiums.

ACH is wired into every demand deposit account in the country.
An enterprise who wants to make or collect a payment using ACH can do so
and plan on being able to reach every banked consumer and enterprise in U.S.

Consumers holding general purpose reloadable (GPR) prepaid cards
can have funds deposited into those cards via ACH.

ACH was designed to keep costs low for participating banks.

The U.S. government offered to pay Social Security benefits via ACH.
Every bank had customers who received Social Security,
which brought on every depository institution in the country within 15 years.
