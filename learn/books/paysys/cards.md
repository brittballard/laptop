## Overview

The cards payments system:

* has "pull" payments with authorization
* is owned by a private network of companies
* is governed by U.S. law and Federal Reserve Bank regulation
* economics are interchange (acquirers to issuers),
  assessments (issuers and acquirers to network),
  and currency conversion
* processes electronically
* manages risk by network definition, augmented by processors and end parties

The cards payments systems are at the heart of consumer commerce,
facilitating trillions of dollars of spending each year.
They are extremely standardized and interoperable.
They are extremely profitable for credit card issuers and other in value chain.

The card industry as we know it began when Bank of America
rolled out its BankAmericard product in California in the 1950s
It licensed BankAmericard to banks outside of California by the mid-1960s,
forming a company, BankAmerica Service Corporation,
to manage the U.S. card program.

In the mid-1970s,
a similar organization was formed to manage the international card program.
Soon after, the U.S. and international companies combined to become Visa.

Separately, another group of California banks formed a competing organization
called the Interbank Card Association and rolled out its MasterCharge card.
In the late 1970s, it renamed itself and its product to Mastercard.

The early work of these companies established
associations of member financial institutions with open membership,
interchange fees,
brand control,
fraud reporting,
and arbitration processes to settle disputes.

The open loop networks enabled a profitable consumer lending business
for card-issuing banks. New relationships could be established not of
a consumer opening a checking account but applying for a credit card.

Card issuing banks serve consumers.
Acquiring banks serve merchants.

In the late 1960s, banks issued automated teller machine (ATM) cards
to checking account customers to enable them to withdraw cash.
Usage required authenticating with a personal identification number (PIN).

Banks began sharing ATM networks.
Banks wanted cost reduction (saving on teller expenses).

In the late 1980s and 1990s,
ATM networks went through a series of mergers moving to non-bank ownership.
Interlink, STAR, and NYCE were some of the largest national networks.
Visa eventually acquired Interlink.
In 2004, First Data Corporation bought STAR and
Metavante bought NYCE.

ATM cards began being accepted at point of sale.
Merchants wanted to eliminate checks with their "bounce" risk.
Merchants had to deploy new acceptance equipment to read
the card's magnetic stripe and to securely accept the cardholder's PIN.

In the mid-1980s, credit cards and debit cards could be accepted by merchants
at point of sale. This led Visa and Mastercard to develop debit products
for retail banks to ride over their credit card network "rails" rather
than over of the shared ATM/PIN debit networks.

In 2006, Mastercard IPO'ed.
In 2008, Visa IPO'ed (the largest in US history to that point).

## Card Types

Charge cards are non-revolving: the cardholder pays in full,
at the end of the billing period, for all charges incurred.

Credit cards provide access to a revolving, unsecured line of credit.
The cardholder can pay the balance in full
or over a period allowed by the card issuer.

Signature debit cards access funds on deposit in cardholder's checking account
authenticated by comparing signature on card to receipt.
Transactions are carried over the Visa or Mastercard network
depending on bank issuer's choice of card brand.

PIN debit cards access funds on deposit in cardholder's checking account
authenticated by entering a PIN on a keypad.
Transactions are carried over the PIN or ATM networks.
They can be used to provide cash back to the consumer at point of sale.

The same physical card is typically used for PIN and signature debit.
The card issuer determines whether both authentication methods are supported.
On swipe, the merchant can look up the issuer's routing options
and determine whether to prompt for PIN or not.

Prior to the [Durbin Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durbin_amendment),
merchants often prompted for PIN
in order to route the transaction over the lower cost PIN debit network.

Prepaid cards access funds from a pre-funded account. Examples are gift cards
and typically operate over the Visa or Mastercard networks.

## Acceptance Environments

Card-present (CP) transactions occur when the cardholder uses their card at a
terminal. Network rules usually protect the merchant from fraud risk.

Card-not-present (CNP) transactions occur when the cardholder is making a remote
purchase such as online or by phone. Network rules usually don't protect the
merchant from fraud risk.

## Roles

In an open-loop network,
an issuing bank serves the cardholder
and acquiring bank serves the merchant.
The card network sits in the middle,
managing transactions, rules, risk, and disputes.

In a closed-loop network,
a single card company performs the issuing, acquiring, and network functions.

Card issuing involves
soliciting new customers,
underwriting new customers,
furnishing each customer with a card,
authorizing and clearing transactions,
and providing statements.

Card acquiring involves
providing and servicing POS terminals and software,
processing card,
managing disputes,
and providing customer service.
