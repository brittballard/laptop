# 1.3 Formulating Abstractions with Higher-Order Procedures

Procedures that manipulate procedures are called higher-order procedures.

## 1.3.1 Procedures as Arguments

Consider the following procedures:

```lisp
(define (sum-integers a b)
  (if (> a b)
      0
      (+ a (sum-integers (+ a 1) b))))

(define (sum-cubes a b)
  (if (> a b)
      0
      (+ (cube a) (sum-cubes (+ a 1) b))))

(define (pi-sum a b)
  (if (> a b)
      0
      (+ (/ 1.0 (* a (+ a 2))) (pi-sum (+ a 4) b))))
```

They share a common underlying pattern,
differing only in the name of the procedure,
the function of a used to compute the term to be added,
and the function that provides the next value of a.

The presence of such a pattern is strong evidence
that there is a useful abstraction waiting to be brought to the surface:
summation of a series.

We could define a new procedure `sum` that takes as its arguments
the lower and upper bounds `a` and `b`
with the procedures `term` and `next`:

```lisp
(define (sum term a next b)
  (if (> a b)
      0
      (+ (term a)
         (sum term (next a) next b))))
```

Now we can define the original procedures in terms of `sum`
along with helper procedures:

```lisp
(define (sum-integers a b)
  (define (identity x)
    x)
  (sum identity a inc b))

(define (sum-cubes a b)
  (define (inc n)
    (+ n 1))
  (sum cube a inc b))

(define (pi-sum a b)
  (define (pi-term x)
    (/ 1.0 (* x (+ x 2))))
  (define (pi-next x)
    (+ x 4))
  (sum pi-term a pi-next b))
```
